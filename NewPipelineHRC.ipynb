Events end at 1am for UK people and it's not fair to expect us to be up at that time to grab screenshots for record keeping. On that note an export function would be amazing.    Instant breeding on studs is amazing.  Spin the pony is a nice touch.  Id like more variety of tack available to win in races. I have hundreds of Jade Jewels!  The anniversary event was awesome.
